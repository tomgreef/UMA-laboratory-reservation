# Laboratory reservation system for the LCC department

This project presents the development and implementation of a laboratory reservation system tailored to the needs of the Language and Computer Science (LCC in Spanish) department at the University of MÃ¡laga. The system's primary objective is to streamline the allocation of laboratories to different academic groups while adhering to a set of predefined constraints.

The system allows administrators to import reservation lists efficiently, enabling a centralized approach to reduce scheduling conflicts and optimize resource allocation.

One of the key features of this system is its ability to handle complex constraints. Teachers can specify their requirements, such as preferred laboratories, location, equipment availability, and time slots. The system then intelligently assigns laboratories to groups, taking into account these constraints, ensuring a fair and efficient allocation process.

To accomplish this, the project utilizes task schedulers, genetic algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces. It also incorporates a Docker solution, along with the necessary manuals for deployment and usage.

In conclusion, this laboratory reservation system offers a comprehensive solution to the complex task of laboratory allocation, benefiting both teachers and administrators by optimizing resource utilization and minimizing conflicts.
